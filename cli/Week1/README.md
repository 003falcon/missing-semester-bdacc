# CLI Treasure Hunt

Welcome to the CLI Treasure Hunt! In this adventure, you'll embark on a journey through a mysterious file system, using your command-line skills to navigate, search, and uncover hidden treasures.

## Objective

Your task for Week 1 is to find the hidden "treasure.txt" file hidden somewhere within the depths of this repository's directory structure. The path to the treasure is obfuscated, and you'll need to leverage your knowledge of various command-line tools and techniques to decipher the clues and uncover its location.

## Backstory

Legend has it that a renowned hacker, known as the "CLI Wizard," has hidden a priceless treasure deep within this file system labyrinth. The treasure contains a secret message that could unlock untold riches and knowledge. However, the Wizard has devised a series of challenges and puzzles to test the mettle of those seeking the treasure.

Only those with mastery over the command-line interface and a keen eye for detail will be able to navigate the twists and turns of this digital maze and claim the treasure for themselves.

## Rules

1. You must use only command-line tools and techniques to find the treasure. No graphical file browsers or external tools are allowed.
2. You can navigate through the file system, search for files and directories, and inspect their contents using any CLI commands you know.
3. Modifying, deleting, or creating new files or directories is strictly prohibited.
4. Once you've found the "treasure.txt" file, submit your solution as per the instructions in the "Submissions" section below.

## Hints and Clues

- The path to the treasure is not straightforward. You'll need to think outside the box and combine different commands to uncover the hidden clues.
- Pay close attention to file names, extensions, and hidden files/directories. The clues could be lurking anywhere.
- Some commands like `find`, `grep`, and `cat` might come in handy for your search.
- Don't forget to explore the "resources" directory for command references and additional hints.
- See the resources folder for more cheatsheets.

## Submissions

To submit your solution, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a new text file (e.g., `submission_name.txt`) under `Week1/submissions` with either the full path to the "treasure.txt" file or the contents of the file itself.
3. Commit your changes and create a pull request with a descriptive title and brief explanation of your solution.

Good luck! Raise issues if you are unclear.
