Tools to energize your workflow. Made as a part of BDACC's Summer Semester Bootcamp. 

## Why use Git ?
Git is a powerful version control system. Even when you’re working by yourself, it can let you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more. When working with others, it’s an invaluable tool for seeing what other people have changed, as well as resolving conflicts in concurrent development.

Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions like:

- Who wrote this module?
- When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why was it edited?
- Over the last 1000 revisions, when/why did a particular unit test stop working?

While other VCSs exist, Git is the de facto standard for version control.
