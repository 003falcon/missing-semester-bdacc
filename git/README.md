# Learn Git by Doing

You can learn a thousand courses on how does git work, but the ONLY way to learn Git is to get your hands dirty, and this repo contains exactly that.

## Task 1 : Let's Diagnose some errors
In this task, students will act as code doctors, diagnosing and fixing issues in a collection of scripts written in different programming languages. Use Git and GitHub to collaborate and contribute your solutions to this repo.
In this folder, you will find folders of different programming languages(`python`, `C`, `rust` etc) containing files with small errors(logical, syntactical) in them. Try refactoring them, and then raising a PR with the branch name in the format `fix-<script-lang>-<type-of-error>` (an example would be `fix-python-syntax_error`). At any point, if you feel difficulty, the resources are there in this repository itself(otherwise, feel free to reach out on the Whatsapp group of the Missing Semester). The basic steps to be followed are :

- **Fork the repository** to their own GitHub account(if you don't have, make one!).
- **Clone your version** of forked repository to your local machines.
- **Diagnose the issue**: In the programming language of your liking, identify issues that need to be addressed.
- **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch(see the resources shared with you!) for each issue you want to fix, with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-python-syntax_error`).
- **Fix the issue**: Make the necessary changes to the script(s) to fix the issue or improve the code.
- **Commit changes**: Students should commit their changes to their branch with a descriptive commit message explaining the issue they fixed or the improvement they made.
- **Push to GitHub**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
- **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main repository, describing the issue you fixed and the changes you made.
 
As part of reviewing commitee, we will review each PR and provide feedback or suggestions if needed. Discussions and debates about best practices, language-specific conventions, and alternative solutions will be done there itself. Once approved, we will merge the PR into the main repository(and Github will give you a medal for the same).
*Note* - PRs will be used for evaluation, and the **certificates will be given based on your participation in this task**.
